# This reposiroty contains the notebook where we compare various performance matrices between a convolutional neural network, a quantum convolutional neural network and a hybrid model on the MNIST digits dataset.

Pennylane is compatable with 
tensorflow==2.10.0
keras==2.10.0
It is recommended to create virtual environment so there are no conflicts between tensorflow versions or run in cloud based runtime.
